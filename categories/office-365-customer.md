## What is Office 365 (Customer)?
Office 365 lets your customers manage their calendars in Outlook. They can connect their Outlook calendars with Nexudus. 

## How the Office 365 (Customer) Integration Works 
Customers just need to enable the integration from their account on the Members Portal. Once their Office 365 is connected, they can start booking resources in your space directly from their Outlook calendar. Bookings they make via the members Portal are also automatically added to their Outlook calendar.
