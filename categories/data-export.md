## What are Data Exports?
Nexudus lets you export data from any list on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. All the data available in your account for this specific type of record type is exported in a single XLS file. 

This is particularly useful if you want to access and use your space's data beyond [Reports](/v3/docs/reports){target="_blank"} and [Nexudus Explore](/v3/docs/nexudus-explore){target="_blank"}.

## How Data Exports Work
You can export data by ticking the checkbox next to any of the listed records and then clicking on **Export  records** in the *Bulk Actions* menu.

:::(Info) (All the records available in your account will automatically be exported, regardless of how many you select.)
:::

If you want to limit the records included in your export file, use the **Views** menu or any of the **Filters** available.

*For example, you only want to export customers who are part of a certain team and/or have a company account.*

Most exports only take a few seconds and you can find your XLS file in the *Downloads* folder of your device.
