{{variable.Customers_CAP}} with access to the {{variable.MembersPortal}} can make {{variable.bookings}} directly from the **{{variable.Bookings_CAP}}** page.  

They can book for [themselves](/docs/booking-for-yourself){target=`_blank`} or their [{{variable.team}}](/docs/booking-for-your-team){target=`_blank`} using the different {{variable.booking}} views. 

They can also update or cancel their {{variable.bookings}} at any time.

You can make your **{{variable.Bookings_CAP}}** page [visible](/docs/configuring-members-portal-pages-visibility){target=`_blank`} to specific {{variable.usergroups}} or to the public.

### Booking for yourself

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} can make {{variable.bookings}} for themselves, add guests, and select any additional services offered all in one streamlined process.

{{variable.MoreInformation}} [{{variable.booking}} for yourself](/docs/booking-for-yourself){target=`_blank`}.

### Booking for your {{variable.team}}

For {{variable.customers}} who are a part of a {{variable.team}}, the {{variable.team}} {{variable.admins}} can [grant access](/docs/editing-team-members-access){target=`_blank`} for them to book for the team. They can make {{variable.bookings}} for one or several {{variable.team}} {{variable.members}}. Each {{variable.member}} can also update their {{variable.bookings}} and add guests or additional services.

### Available booking views

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} have several {{variable.booking}} views they can use to make {{variable.bookings}}. Each view also has different filters they can apply to narrow down their choices.

#### Card view

This view displays {{variable.resources}} in a simple list-style format. Each {{variable.resource}} is shown with key details, such as availability, capacity, and features. {{variable.Customers_CAP}} can quickly compare options and make their selection.

*For example, if a {{variable.customer}} just needs a meeting room at a specific date and time, the available {{variable.resource}} card view can help them find the first available {{variable.resource}} in just a few clicks.*

#### Calendar view

For {{variable.customers}} who need to make {{variable.bookings}} based on specific dates and times, the calendar view shows availability by day, week and month. This makes it easy to see which {{variable.resources}} are free or already booked for a particular time frame. 

*For example, if some {{variable.resources}} are booked by the same {{variable.teams}}, the calendar view can let other {{variable.customers}} know when the {{variable.resource}} is used and anticipate by booking the {{variable.resource}} ahead of time.*

#### {{variable.FloorPlan_View}}

If {{variable.resources}} are connected to a {{variable.floorplan}}, {{variable.customers}} can see an interactive layout of the available {{variable.resources}} on the {{variable.floorplan}} view. {{variable.Customers_CAP}} can select the exact {{variable.location}} within a {{variable.floorplan}}, providing a more visual and detailed way to choose a specific {{variable.resource}} or unit.

*For example, if you offer a hot-desk area in your {{variable.space}}, a {{variable.floorplan}} view can be helpful for {{variable.customers}} who want to work next to one another.*

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} can switch between the different {{variable.booking}} views by clicking the relevant icon in the top right corner of the page.
