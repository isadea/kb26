## What is {{variable.Archilogic}}? 
{{variable.Archilogic}} is an interior space platform that allows you to create, manage and share 2D and 3D floor plan models. Our integration lets you import your {{variable.Archilogic}} floor plans to {{variable.Nexudus}} for customers and admins to use.

:::(Warning) (Using the {{variable.Archilogic}} integration adds a fixed **€/£/$50 monthly charge** to your Nexudus subscription per location enabled and a **€/£/$10 monthly charge** per imported floor plan model.)

## How the {{variable.Archilogic}} Integration Works 
You first need to open an {{variable.Archilogic}} account and create your floor plans. Once your floor plans are ready, you can enable the integration in {{variable.Nexudus}}. No need to create the floor plans beforehand. We'll import the selected floor plans along with their items and create a floor plan for each of them in Nexudus. From there, you'll be able to edit the floor plan and assign its items to customer contracts.
