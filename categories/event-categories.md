## What are Event Categories?
Event categories let you group and organize events by type or theme. 

*For example, you can create a **Conference** category for events with guest speakers and a **Networking** category for monthly casual get-togethers between members of your space.*

Categories also act as filters on the **Events** page of your Members Portal.
