## What Are {{variable.DiscussionBoards_CAP}}?
The message board is a community feature that encourages your customers to communicate on the members portal. Your customers have access to a simplified version of the message board called the discussion board via the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. They can start, follow, and like conversations. They can mention other customers and receive notifications about the latest messages in their conversations. 

The message board has two main components: groups and conversations. As an admin you have control over all conversations via the message board, including conversations started by customers. You can edit or delete any customer message or conversation. 

## Groups 
Groups are customer subsets you define to control who can access specific conversations within *Discussion boards*.  
:::(Info) (Discussion board groups can only be created from the {{variable.AdminPanel}}.)
:::
Customers only have the option to assign groups to their conversations on the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. 

Each group has a designated administrator who can be a customer or one of your space's admins. You can add as many customers as you want to your groups. Every group you create needs an access level. There are three access levels available:

#### Private

Customers who aren't part of the group can't see or contribute to its conversations.

#### Restricted

Customers who aren't part of the group can see its conversations but they can't contribute to them.

#### Public
Any customer who has access to the discussion board page can see and contribute to the group's conversations.

## Conversations
Conversations are simply message threads that customers and Nexudus admins with a customer account can create and use. Conversations can be used to network, share content or even make important announcements. You can edit and delete any conversation via the {{variable.AdminPanel}}, including conversations started by customers. Customers can only edit and delete their own conversations and messages from the Discussion boards. 

Conversations that aren't linked to any group are visible to all customers who can access the Discussion boards page by default.

Customers can start conversations and mention each other in them. They can also like, follow and mute conversations. They can't create groups but they can assign existing groups to their conversations. The discussion board page is also connected to the Directory page.

## Tags
Tags help your customers find relevant conversations and make it easier for them to find people with similar interests. Customers can add tags when they start any discussion board conversation. You can edit these tags from the message board at any point.

## Discussion Board Notifications
All customers receive daily notifications between 8 and 10 a.m. about the latest messages sent in their conversations. They receive these notifications via email and through the Passport app if they have it on their phone.

When a customer is mentioned in a conversation, they automatically start following the conversation and are notified as new messages are added.
