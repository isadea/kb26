## What Is NexClicker? 

NexClicker is an admin app available on iOS and Android that lets you keep track of the number of customers entering and leaving your space. 

## How NexClicker Works 
All you need to do is log in using an admin account and then start tapping the **Check-in** & **Check-out** button based on how many people come in and how many leave.

Your space's maximum capacity is based on your **Building capacity**. You can easily change this setting via **Settings > Check-in settings**.
