## What is {{variable.NexBoard}}? 
{{variable.NexBoard}} is a Nexudus app that turns your tablets into room displays. {{variable.Customers_CAP}} can see a {{variable.resource}}'s availability and book that {{variable.resource}} directly from the tablet or via the {{variable.Passport}}. The app is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexudusspacescheckin){target="_blank"} and the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/nexboard-by-nexudus/id1183944137){target="_blank"}.

## How {{variable.NexBoard}} Works
You can set up {{variable.NexBoard}} in three simple steps. 

1. Purchase a tablet for each {{variable.resource}} you'd like to connect to {{variable.NexBoard}}. 
2. Set up the tablet and download {{variable.NexBoard}}.
3. Connect the tablet to a {{variable.resource}}.

If you have {{variable.resource}} [connected to multiple {{variable.floorplanitems}}](/v3/docs/connecting-floor-plan-items-to-resources#connecting-multiple-floor-plan-units-to-resources){target=`_blank`}, such as a hot desk or phone booth bank, you can set up {{variable.NexBoard}} so {{variable.customers}} can select {{variable.items}} from the same tablet. 

You can use the same admin account to connect multiple {{variable.resources}} as long as each {{variable.resource}} has its own tablet. 
 
## Tablet Requirements
You need at least one tablet meeting the requirements detailed below to use {{variable.NexBoard}}. You can choose to set up multiple tablets with {{variable.NexBoard}} if you want each {{variable.resource}} to have its own {{variable.NexBoard}} display.

## FAQ

### Can I use the same admin account for multiple tablets?
Absolutely! You can [set up](/v3/docs/setting-up-nexboard){target=`_blank`} all your {{variable.NexBoard}} tablets using the same account as long as they are a full unrestricted {{variable.admin}} or a restricted {{variable.admin}} with a {{variable.NexBoard}} [user role](/v3/docs/user-roles-for-apps){target=`_blank`}. 

### How does NexBoard work with combined resources? 
NexBoard will show that a {{variable.resource}} is unavailable when blocked by a combined {{variable.resource}} booking.  

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} can only book a {{variable.resource}} from a tablet directly connected to that {{variable.resource}}.
