## What is Isofy?
Isofy is a network integration in partnership with Nexudus. It offers the same benefits and features in Nexudus as a RADIUS or MikroTik network without the hassle of installing the necessary hardware and setting up the network yourself. Isofy supports you through the process based on your space's setup and needs.

## How the Isofy Integration Works
Isofy sets up your network according to your instructions. Once they've set up the network for you, you just need to enable the integration in Nexudus and you can start using Isofy. 
:::(Warning) (Isofy handles all support and troubleshooting requests.)
