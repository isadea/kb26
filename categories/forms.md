## What Are Forms?
Forms are a feature that helps you collect information from customers and use this information either in Nexudus or externally through export files.

**Example**
*You want to collect feedback from a select few customers. Instead of creating a survey sent to a large number of customers and then look for the select few' answers, you can create a form and only send it to the relevant customers.*


## How Forms Work

You first [create the form](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/adding-forms){target="_blank"}'s structure before adding the relevant questions. You can combine different question types in your forms to collect a wide array of information. 

Once your questions are ready, you can [preview the form](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/previewing-forms){target="_blank"} to make sure everything is displayed as you intended. The preview link essentially lets you see the form as your customers will be able to see it when they click on the invite link. If you're happy with the way the form looks, you can go ahead and [send it to customers](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/sending-forms){target="_blank"} using your method of choice among the available options.

Unlike [surveys](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/survey-reports){target="_blank"}, you can only send {{variable.forms}} manually, to one {{variable.customer}} at a time.

You can also send multiple forms at once to a specific customer.

Form results don't generate their own reports, but you can access each customer's answers directly via the **CRM** tab in their account or through the **Sent Requests** tab in every form. 

## Question Types
Nexudus offers multiple form question types to give your space the opportunity to collect all the information it may need. You define each question's type when you add them to your forms. The available question types are listed and detailed below: 

### **Text**
Customers answer the question by adding a single line of text. This type doesn't have a character limit.

### **Yes/no**
Customers answer the question by selecting YES or NO from a drop-down list.
