## Preparing for your call

You don't need to prepare anything before your calls with our team unless you'd like us to troubleshoot a specific issue. 

We always encourage you to give us as many details as possible while booking your call. This helps your support specialist understand your needs better and help you reach your goals on the day of the call.
