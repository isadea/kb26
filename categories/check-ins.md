## What are Check-ins?

Check-ins are essentially logs of when your customers arrive at your space and when they leave it (check-outs). 

Check-ins serve multiple purposes including knowing who's in your space at all times or keep track of customer's presence in your space via reports. You can also use the check-in system to limit the amount of time that members on a specific plan can spend in your space, by setting appropriate time limits in your plans.

## How Check-ins Work

Customers can check-in using one or multiple of the following methods: 

#### Manual Methods 
Manual methods mean that either you or the customer manually need to record the check-ins and check-outs. 

* [Manually via the Admin Panel](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/manually-checking-in-customers){target="_blank"}

An admin manually records check-ins and check-outs via the Operations section on the Admin Panel. 
*  [Using NexIO](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/checking-in-out-using-nexio){target="_blank"}


Customers enter their PIN code or tap their phone with the Passport app open to check in and out of your space.

* [Using RFID cards and readers](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/checking-in-using-rfid-readers-cards){target="_blank"}

Customers are checked-in and out of your space when they tap an access card on a RFID reader connected to a device that's also connected to your Nexudus account.

#### Automated Methods

* [Using Wi-Fi connection and access tokens](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/checking-in-using-wi-fi){target="_blank"}

Customers are automatically checked in when they connect to your space's Wi-Fi network. If their device stays inactive for more than 15 minutes they're automatically checked out. 
* [Using access control systems](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/access-control-check-in){target="_blank"}

Customers are automatically checked in and out of your space when they unlock specific doors that you've connected when completing your access control system integration. 


The check-in methods you decide to implement willl vary based on how you want customers to be able to check-in. 

:::(Info) (Customers will always need [passes](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/passes){target="_blank"} or [access tokens](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/checking-in-using-wi-fi){target="_blank"} in their account to check in to your space. )

If they don't have a valid pass or access token, they simply will be recorded as a [failed check-in](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/monitoring-failed-check-ins){target="_blank"}.
