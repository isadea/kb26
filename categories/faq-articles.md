## What are {{variable.FAQArticles_CAPS}}?

{{variable.FAQarticles}} are a quick and easy way for your space to provide answers to common questions {{variable.customers}} often have directly on the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. You can add as many {{variable.FAQarticles}} as you need and even group them into categories.

*For example, you can create {{variable.FAQarticles}} to help new {{variable.customers}} navigate your {{variable.space}}. You can also create dedicated {{variable.FAQarticles}} for things such as safety rules and regulations.*

## How FAQ Articles Work
You [create FAQ articles](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/adding-faq-articles){target="_blank"} {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}} and publish them on the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. You can edit them at any point and add or remove information as needed.  You can also [organize them into categories](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/adding-faq-categories){target="_blank"} to help customers browse more easily through the different articles. 

Logged in customers can access the FAQ page by clicking **Support > FAQ** in the navigation menu.

The FAQ page is also accessible from the footer of your {{variable.MembersPortal}} to anyone visiting the portal.
