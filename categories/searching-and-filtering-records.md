{{variable.Nexudus}} makes it easy to find and organize information quickly and efficiently. Whether you're looking for a specific {{variable.customer}} or narrowing down a list of {{variable.bookings}}, global search and various filters streamline your workflow, help navigate your records, and manage your data effectively. 

## Search vs Filters

Search helps find information in your account using keywords, while filters narrow down the results. Combining both gives you flexibility and precision when scanning many records to find what you need.

### Global search

You can quickly search your account using global search. From {{variable.invoices}} to notes left by other {{variable.admins}}, you can search everything using keywords or phrases to generate a list of matching records. 

*For example, if a {{variable.customer}} enquires about an old {{variable.helpdeskmessage}}, you can search for any terms used in the {{variable.message}} to quickly find the original {{variable.message}}. This makes troubleshooting easier and improves {{variable.customer}} experience by reducing the frustration related to searching many records.*

Global search is an excellent starting point for finding information and returns precise results when using niche keywords. However, if you use more common search terms, you'll need to refine the results with the filters provided.

### {{variable.Filters_CAP}}

You can organize and refine your search results using filters. The filters available depend on the record type you're searching and its key properties.

*For example, if you're searching for an {{variable.invoice}}, you can narrow down the list of {{variable.invoices}} by applying filters like {{variable.invoice}} number, total, paid, etc. The results will change to show only {{variable.invoices}} that match your selected criteria. Other records like {{variable.Products_CAP}} will have filters based on the properties of {{variable.products}} like SKU and price instead.*

You can also apply a keyword as a filter to refine records using list search.
