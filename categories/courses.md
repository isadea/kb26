Courses can be used in an array of scenarios such as:

* Internal training 
* Community building
* Self-learning offers

## How Courses work

You first create a course and then build its content by adding lessons. You can also organize lessons in sections.

Courses are the final product that includes sections and lessons. Course sections are the learning units that help you define the structure of your courses and group lessons. Course lessons are the building blocks of your course sections that contain specific training material or educational content needed to complete your courses.
