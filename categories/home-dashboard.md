## What's the {{variable.DashboardTabs_CAP}}? 
The {{variable.DashboardTabs_CAP}} is the first page {{variable.admins}} see when they log in to your {{variable.AdminPanel}}. This home dashboard includes a number of tabs that are customizable to let each {{variable.admin}} see information that's most relevant to them and their {{variable.team}}.

*For example, a custom {{variable.dashboardtab}} that shows all scheduled visitors and tasks assigned to you as a space manager.*

You can also share your {{variable.dashboardtabs}} with other {{variable.admins}} in your {{variable.location}} to help your {{variable.team}} stay on top of important space metrics and tasks. 



## How the {{variable.DashboardTabs_CAP}} works
You create a {{variable.dashboard}} tab and then add any number of cards. Each card on your {{variable.dashboard}} pulls data from your account, such as {{variable.bookings}}, invoices, {{variable.opportunities}}, and more. Some cards are general while others are related to records linked to you.
:::(Info) (You're the only admin who can see your custom {{variable.dashbaordtabs}} by default.)
 You can easily [share any of your custom tabs](/v3/docs/sharing-home-dashboards){target="_blank"} with all other {{variable.admins}} with access to that location and even let them edit the tabs.

## FAQ 
### Do I need a specific role to create {{variable.dashboardtabs}}?
No, any {{variable.fullunrestrictedadmin}} and any roled {{variable.admin}} with the **BusinessSettings** permissions can create and share {{variable.dashboardtabs}}. 

### Is there a limit on the number of custom dashboards I can add? 
While there is no limitation on the number of custom dashboards you can create, we recommend keeping the number of tabs under 10 for easy browsing and optimal display. 

### Can I share my {{variable.dashboards}} only with a select few admins? 
No, you're the only user who can see your {{variable.dashboards}} by default. If you [share your {{variable.dashboards}}](/v3/docs/sharing-dashboard-tabs){target="_blank"} they're automatically visible to {{variable.admins}} with access to that {{variable.location}}.

Cards are visible to all admins? 
Can mix sensors with other cards 

Sensors are the only cards that can be combined into one 
Regular data is 1 card per element or data point but you can have them side by side

Grouping could be pretty useful
