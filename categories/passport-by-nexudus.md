## What Is Passport ? 
Passport is a mobile app available on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/passport-by-nexudus/id1100057771?mt=8){target="_blank"} and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexudusspaces&hl=en_GB&gl=US){target="_blank"} that your customers can download to access all the features of your {{variable.MembersPortal}} on the go. 


## How Passport Works 
Any customer with access to your Members Portal can download the app and log in using their {{variable.MembersPortal}} credentials. 
:::(warning) (Using one of our [SSO integrations](/v3/docs/user-authentication){target="_blank"}?)
Customers can also use their credentials from other platforms to log in to {{variable.Passport}}. 
:::

Once they're logged in, they can use the app to do everything they would normally do on the {{variable.MembersPortal}} such as:


* **Connect with other customers and the community**

The directory shows details from other customers of your space. They can see profiles and directly message them.

* **Book resources**

Customers can book any of the meeting rooms you've made available in your space via Passport. They just need to enter the date and time of the booking and the app shows them the resources available.

* **Purchase plans and products**

Customers can sign up to new plans or purchase additional products. They also get an overview of the current plans and products they have on their account.

* **Edit their profile details**

Customers can access their profile at any time by going to My section on the app and edit the different fields as they need.

* **Pay their invoices**

Customers can pay their invoices directly through the app from the **Invoices** section.



You can tweak the sections available to customers via **[Settings > Companion apps](https://dashboard.nexudus.com/settings/4/0/1){target="_blank"}** on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. 



## {{variable.Passport}} Compatibility Chart

On top of these features, the {{variable.Passport}} and its white-label equivalent work alongside some of our integrations to streamline your customers experience. 

Some of our access control integrations let your customers unlock doors either directly through the white-label version of Passport or automation tiles.

## FAQ
### What's the difference between the Passport app and the white-label Passport app? 

The white-label Passport app lets you customize the app's branding to make it your own. White-label apps are also listed on both app stores under your space name. All Nexudus branding is effectively removed. On top of this, some additional features such as door unlocking through an integrated access control system is only available to white-label users.

### Can I customize Passport without getting the white-label version? 
You can change enable/disable specific sections of the app in all versions of Passport. You can also edit the main colors used on the app.
