Multiple customer profiles let {{variable.admins}} create multiple customer accounts using a single email address.

*For example, a customer named **John Doe** can have 2 separate customer accounts with the same email address and use the same login details to access both accounts on the {{variable.MembersPortal}}.*

Multiple customer profiles are useful in several scenarios:

* **Customers who want a company and an individual account**

*For example, John Doe is the manager of an existing team (Meaco Ltd.). He'd like to have a company account designated as the team's paying customer and his own account using the same email address.*

You can easily create both accounts using our **Company structure** {{variable.wizard}}.

This customer will be able to switch between his two accounts by clicking on his name in the top right corner of the page.

* **Customers who need to be part of multiple teams with merged invoicing**

A customer cannot be part of more than one team with merged invoicing. This means that if a customer needs to be part of multiple teams with merged invoicing, they need an individual account for each of them.

*For example, Jane Smith works for two companies that rent private offices in your space. If both teams have merged invoicing, you need a second account for Jane to add her to the second company's team.*

Once she logs in to the Members Portal, she will be able to switch between her two accounts by clicking on her name in the top right corner of the page.

:::(Info) (Add the team name in the **Full name** field of at least one of the customer accounts to help the customer identify the different accounts at a glance.)
:::

* **{{variable.Customers_CAP}} who are enrolled in both a {{variable.plan}} and a {{variable.virtualoffice}} {{variable.plan}}**

{{variable.Plans_CAP}} and {{variable.virtualoffice}} {{variable.plans}} work differently, which means {{variable.customers}} need a separate account for each. 

*For example, a {{variable.customer}} might use your space as their registered business address for mail handling through a {{variable.virtualoffice}} {{variable.plan}}, while also maintaining a dedicated desk {{variable.plan}} for occasional in-person work sessions.*

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} can easily switch between their two accounts by clicking on their name in the top right corner of the page.

The {{variable.virtualoffice}} account is identified by a green tag next to the {{variable.customer}}'s name.
