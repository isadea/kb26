## What is on-site training?
One or more of our senior support specialists come to your space to train you and your staff. This is a great way to have everyone's questions answered on the spot and learn how to use the platform. 


#### Personalized training
Every space is different and what better way to learn than from Nexudus experts who understand your requirements? Once you book your training session, your trainer gets in touch with you to learn more about your space and discuss your expectations. They will then use the information you shared to prepare a training session that targets your space's unique needs and requirements.

#### In-person learning
Studies have shown that people learn best from being taught by others and by implementing what they learn. On-site training covers these two pillars of learning and eases you into using the system, guided by people who know Nexudus inside out. 

#### Nexudus expertise
All our trainers are senior members of the support team who have helped hundreds of customers and solved countless tickets. If you've ever booked a training call, you'll know that no question or setup is too complex for our support team. On-site training sessions are a great way to be trained by experts and learn pro tips to make the most of the platform.
