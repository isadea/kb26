## What Is {{variable.SmartaLock}}?

{{variable.SmartaLock}} is a smart locker system. The {{variable.SmartaLock}} system can work with lockers you already have. Customers can open and lock lockers using a Nexudus automation tile that you can create in just a few clicks.

## How the {{variable.SmartaLock}} Integration Works
You create an automation tile for your locker bank and enable the integration on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. Once you've completed the integration and installed the tile on your locker bank, customers can start using the tile to open/close lockers straight away. 

They can open lockers and lock them by either scanning the tile's QR code and logging in to the {{variable.MembersPortal}} or by simply tapping their phone on the tile with the {{variable.Passport}} open.
