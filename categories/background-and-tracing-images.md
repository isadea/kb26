You can upload two types of images to support your floor plans, each serving a different purpose. We recommend using both to build accurate and customer-friendly floor plans.

## Background images

These appear behind your floor plan and are **visible to customers** when they book through the **Members Portal or Passport app**. They’re great for adding context or branding to the space.

## Tracing images

These are **only visible on the Admin Panel** and customers never see tracing images. Tracing images are designed to **help you accurately scale and draw your floor plans**.
