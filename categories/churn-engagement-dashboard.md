## What is the {{variable.ChurnEngagementDashboard}}?
The {{variable.ChurnEngagementDashboard}} lets you know how many of your {{variable.members}} are are likely to churn within the next 30 days and how engaged each of them are with your space. Our AI-powered models look at your space's data  and engagement predictions are based on patterns in member behavior. 

For example, you may not notice that your members usually cancel their contracts between day 200 and 250, but the {{variable.ChurnEngagementDashboard}}. On top of that,  can help you build a stronger relationship with your {{variable.members}}. Stronger customer relationship often leads to a higher customer retention rate.

Your dashboard is divided into three sections designed to give you a clear picture of churn and engagement for your space.

In {{variable.Nexudus}}, your churn rate is the percentage of {{glossary.active members}} who are likely to cancel their contract by the end of the current calendar month. 

*For example, if you have 100 active members at the start of January and your churn rate is 10%, you could expect around  90 active members by the end of the month.*

The lower your churn rate, the better. 

In {{variable.Nexudus}}, your engagement score determines how likely your average {{glossary.active members}} are to renew their {{variable.contract}} with your space. We divide {{variable.members}} {{variable.engagement}} into four segments: **high**, **medium**, **low**, and **none**. 

*For example, an average engagement score of 68% means that there's a 68% chance that your average member will renew their contract for at least another billing cycle.*

We take a number of {{glossary.attributes}} into consideration, both from your space and each member to calculate their engagement. 

### Engagement  
This section helps you see the customer engagement ranges in your space to see how engaged your members are and check segments that aren't as engaged.
