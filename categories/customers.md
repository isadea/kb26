## What are {{variable.Customers_CAP}}?

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} are people and companies who use your {{variable.space}}. {{variable.Customers_CAP}} can either be **{{variable.members}}** or **{{variable.contacts}}**. All members and contacts are also one of two types - individual or company. 

### {{variable.Members_CAP}} 
{{variable.Members_CAP}} are {{variable.customers}} who are currently signed up to at least one {{variable.plan}}. {{variable.Members_CAP}} can have access to your {{variable.MembersPortal}} to make {{variable.bookings}} and manage their account. You can suspend {{variable.members}} and revoke their access to the {{variable.MembersPortal}} at any point from the {{variable.AdminPanel}}.

You can add {{variable.members}} to teams. {{variable.Members_CAP}} are charged as they make bookings or purchase products. They are invoiced at the end of every billing cycle, as defined in their plan's contract. You also have the option to invoice {{variable.members}} as they purchase products and make bookings. 

When {{variable.members}} cancel their {{variable.contracts}}, they automatically become {{variable.contacts}} in {{variable.Nexudus}} as the contract ends.

### {{variable.Contacts_CAP}}
Contacts are customers who use your space but aren't currently signed up to any plan. Contacts can also have user accounts and access to the Members Portal to make bookings and manage their account. You can suspend {{variable.contacts}} and revoke their access to the {{variable.MembersPortal}} at any point from the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. You can also add contacts to teams. 

When contacts sign up to a plan, they automatically become members in Nexudus. Contacts don't become members when they purchase recurring products.

## Customer Types 
You always need to choose a customer type when adding members and contacts from the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. There are two customer types: individual and company.

**Individual customers** are usually directly linked to a person who uses your space. 
For example a freelancer who books hot-desks 

**Company customers** are linked to a company with a primary contact who is a physical person using your space. Company customers aren't teams. 


When customers register via the {{variable.MembersPortal}}, they are automatically labeled as individual customers. {{variable.Customers_CAP}} you import using CSV files are also labeled as individual customers by default. You can change this setting at any point via the {{variable.customer}}'s record.
