You can create your own custom pages for your {{variable.MembersPortal}} via the **Template files editor** on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}.

## Custom Page Types
You have the option between two types of custom pages based on the content you want to add to your {{variable.MembersPortal}} and your familiarity with web development.

### Static Pages
Static pages are HTML pages that you can create directly {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}} using our built-in editor. You add your content to the page and it is displayed as is until you manually edit it, hence the term static page.

*For example, a custom page dedicated to your team with the name and photo of your staff.*

Custom static pages are ideal if your content is purely informational, you have no experience in web development and you don't want to hire a professional developer.

### Dynamic Pages

Dynamic pages still use HTML, but they also rely on additional programming languages such as JSON, React or even PHP. This combination allows pages to be interactive and adapt their content based on each user's interaction with them. 

*The Bookings section of your {{variable.MembersPortal}} is an example of a dynamic page. Based on the filters you apply, the content displayed on the page changes.*
