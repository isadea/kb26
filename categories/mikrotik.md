## What is {{variable.MikroTik}}?
{{variable.MikroTik}} is a router-based method to control who can connect to your Wi-Fi network. It can also be used to record customer check-ins and check-outs based on when they connect to your Wi-Fi network.

## How the {{variable.MikroTik}} Integration Works
You need a modem, a router, and a level 6 license from [{{variable.MikroTik}}](https://mikrotik.com/){target="_blank"} to integrate with Nexudus. You should set up your network before enabling the integration in Nexudus. 

:::(Warning) (We do not provide support to set up or troubleshoot your network.)
The instructions we provide are guidelines to help you connect your network and Nexudus aimed at professionals with experience setting up router-based Wi-Fi networks.

Once the integration is enabled, customers can access your Wi-Fi network through valid time/day passes or access tokens. As they connect to your network, they're automatically checked in. If they stay inactive for more than 15 minutes, they're automatically checked out.
