Onboarding virtual office customers is a simple and easy process that you can handle from the Admin Panel or have customers complete themselves on the Members Portal. 

Whether the onboarding is completed by the customer or an admin, it includes the same steps:

1. **Sign up for the plan**
2. **Defining beneficiaries**
3. **Complete identity checks**

We usually recommend making the most of our built-in onboarding by letting customers onboard themselves.

*Admins complete the onboarding for customers. This type of onboarding is only recommended if you don't make virtual offices available for purchase on your Members Portal or you don't want customers to onboard themselves.*

*This option involves a lot more administrative work for your team.*

* [**Customer-led onboarding**](/docs/virtual-office-onboarding-customer){target=`_blank`}
*Customers sign up to virtual offices on your Members Portal and onbooard themselves. This type of onboarding is ideal if you want customers to provide all the relevant details.* 

*This option involves minimal administrative work for your team, especially if you use automated identity checks.*
