## What is E-invoicing 
E-invoicing is the digital exchange of invoices between businesses and customers, in a structured, machine-readable format between financial systems. 

The European Economic Area (EEA) is introducing regulations that define how invoices must be formatted to be considered eInvoices. These regulations will come into full force everywhere in Europe by 2030.

Several EU countries are moving faster and introducing their own national mandates, including Spain.

## Understanding the difference between e-invoicing and e-reporting

**E-invoicing** is the process of sending and receiving invoices in a standardized digital format. It replaces PDF or paper invoices with structured data that tax systems can read automatically.



**E-reporting** is the process of sending invoice data directly to local tax authorities. It’s near–real-time reporting of sales, payments, or other required invoicing data.

## FAQ 
### How do I know if I need to use e-invoicing? 
E-invoicing will become a legal requirement across all member countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) within 2 to 3 years. 
If your business isn't operating from the European Economic Area, e-invoicing isn't required, but is available as an option. 

### When should I switch over to e-invoicing and e-reporting? 
As soon as possible if you're located in the European Economic Area! Turning on e-invoicing and e-reporting ahead of your country’s official rollout gives you time to get familiar with the process, test everything, and fix any issues with your accounting setup that may come up before it becomes mandatory.


### Will e-invoicing impact my invoice customization?
No, e-invoicing is a requirement that is processed in the background every time you issue an invoice. Your customization to the PDF version of your invoices remains unchanged.
