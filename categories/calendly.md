## What is {{variable.Calendly}}? 

{{variable.Calendly}} is a scheduling platform that lets users  book a tour of your space based on your availability.

Your {{variable.Calendly}} calendar form replaces the default tour form on your {{variable.MembersPortal}} and syncs the relevant {{variable.visitor}} information in {{variable.Nexudus}} and {{variable.Calendly}}. This includes creating {{variable.opportunities}} and adding them to the relevant {{variable.CRMstages}}. 


## How the {{variable.Calendly}} integration works
**In {{variable.Calendly}}**
You create an event type dedicated to tours and generate an access token in {{variable.Calendly}}. 

**In {{variable.Nexudus}}** 
Once you have them both, you just need to enable the integration on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. Once the integration is enabled, any user will be able to book tours on the {{variable.MembersPortal}} using your {{variable.Calendly}} calendar. 

Users receive two email notifications when they confirm their tour request: 

* A booking confirmation notification from {{variable.Nexudus}} 
* A {{variable.Calendly}} invitation with the details you defined in your event type
