## What is Google Calendar (Administrator)? 
Google Calendar for administrators is an integration that lets your admins place Nexudus bookings from shared Google calendars and automatically sync any new booking made either in Nexudus or Google Calendar. 

## How the Google Calendar (Administrator) Integration Works
You enable the integration by creating one public calendar for each ressource you want to connect in Google Calendar. You can then enable the integration on the {{variable.AdminPanel}} and match each calendar to the relevant resource in Nexudus. 

You only need to let one full unrestricted admin in Nexudus connect the bookings calendar to their Google Calendar account. Other admins can then add the public calendars to their own and manage it from their own account. 

You don't need to worry about double-booking as Nexudus automatically checks for conflicting bookings in Google Calendar before syncing them.  


## Bookings Sync
Once you've enabled the integration, bookings made in Google Calendar are automatically synced in Nexudus. Bookings made in Nexudus are also automatically synced in the connected Google calendars.

## Google Calendar and LiquidSpace
The Google Calendar integration is also a great way to connect your Nexudus calendar to [LiquidSpace](https://help.nexudus.com/v3/docs/liquidspace).
