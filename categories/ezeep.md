## What is {{variable.eZeep}}?
{{variable.eZeep}} is a cloud-based printing solution that lets your customers print from any device. The integration with {{variable.Nexudus}} lets them print using printing credits, pay-per-print, or a combination of both.

## How the {{variable.eZeep}} Integration Works

Once you've set up your {{variable.eZeep}} account and your printers, you can enable the integration on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. 

You'll import your first batch of customers to {{variable.eZeep}} as you complete the integration. From then, you'll need to sync any new customer joining your space as users in {{variable.eZeep}}.

When Nexudus creates a user account in {{variable.eZeep}} for new customers, customers receive an email notification from {{variable.eZeep}} prompting them to log in to their {{variable.eZeep}} account. Once they have accessed their {{variable.eZeep}} account for the first time, they're able to start printing from any of their devices.

When customers are suspended or deleted in Nexudus, we automatically delete their user account in {{variable.eZeep}} within a few minutes.
