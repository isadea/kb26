## What is Zoom?
{{variable.Zoom}} is a video-conferencing software that provides remote conferencing services that combine video conferencing, online meetings, chat, and mobile collaboration.

:::(Info) (The {{variable.Zoom}} integration is included in your {{variable.Nexudus}} subscription at no additional cost.)
:::

This integration works in four different ways:

### Zoom for Events

Lets you provide a Zoom meeting link to all event attendees who RSVP or buy tickets for an event. You can also add alternative hosts who can start and end the meeting on your behalf.


### [Zoom for Bookings](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/using-zoom-for-bookings){target="_blank"}

Lets your customers add their own Zoom meeting link while making a booking. They will need to connect their Zoom account to their Members Portal account. 

### Zoom for Discussion Boards

Lets your customers connect their own Zoom accounts. This enables them to include a Zoom meeting link when starting a new discussion board.

### Zoom for Resources

Lets you provide a Zoom Meeting link to every customer booking a specific resource. 
:::(warning) (You need a licensed Zoom user per resource you want to connect.)
