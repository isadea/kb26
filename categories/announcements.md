## FAQ 
### Can I format the text in my announcements? 
No, announcements currently only support plain text, whihc means no italics, bold, or lists. With that said, you can add emojis and create paragraphs using the *Enter* key. 

### Why is my announcement image cropped or blurry? 
Your announcement images should ideally be 600X350 pixels or above that with a 12:7 aspect ratio. Anything below that and you run the risk of having a blurry image displayed on your Members Portal and Passport app or its white-label equivalent. An aspect ratio that isn't 12:7 and your image may end up cropped.
