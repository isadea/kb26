## What Is Okta?
Okta is an access management platform that helps your customers log in to the Members Portal and Nexudus apps using external user credentials and secure customer authentication.

## How the Okta Integration Works
:::(Info) (You need an Okta account in order to use this integration.)
:::
Once you've integrated Okta in your Nexudus account, your users are able to log in to the Members Portal using the same credentials they use to access your organisation's network. 

Okta provides its own user repository and API to manage users and credentials. You can also choose to let them log in using other identity providers such as:

* Google
* Facebook
* Linkedin
* Microsoft
* Identity Providers supporting OpenID Connect
* Identity Providers supporting SAML 2.0


Okta also offers additional security features such as two-step authentication.
