## What is {{variable.Doordeck}}?
{{variable.Doordeck}} is an access control system that lets your customers autonomously unlock doors and access different areas of space using their phone with the {{variable.Doordeck}} app or automation tiles. Customers are automatically added to access groups as they purchase passes, make bookings or rent desks and offices.

## How the {{variable.Doordeck}} Integration Works
Once you've completed the integration process in both {{variable.Doordeck}} and Nexudus, customers can unlock the doors in your space based on their bookings, contracts, and passes. They can use {{variable.Doordeck}}'s own app or automation tiles that you'll need to set up separately.
