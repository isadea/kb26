## What is {{variable.Spreedly}}?
Spreedly is a service that lets you securely store the card details of your customers and use them to process invoice payments through a payment gateway or third-party API.

Our integration with {{variable.Spreedly}} lets your customers pay their invoices by card through the payment provider of your choice. If the customer agrees to keep their card details on file, Spreedly safely stores them and payments are automatically collected whenever an invoice becomes due. 
:::(Warning) (This integration adds a {{variable.Currencies}}10 charge per month and a {{variable.Currencies}}0.04 charge per transaction to your Nexudus subscription in every location where it is enabled.)
:::


## How {{variable.Spreedly}} works 
You need a {{variable.Spreedly}} account with at least one environment provisioned with a payment gateway that  {{variable.Spreedly}} supports. You then enable the integration {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}}. Once the integration is complete, customers can pay their invoices by card through the payment provider you connected to your Spreedly account.
