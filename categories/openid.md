## What Is {{variable.OpenId}}?
{{variable.OpenId}} is an authentication protocol that lets you delegate user authentication and manage user access through an identity provider that support {{variable.OpenId}} authentication protocol. Practically speaking, this allows your customers to log in to the {{variable.MembersPortal}} using their identity provider credentials instead of the credentials provided by Nexudus. 

## How the {{variable.OpenId}} Integration Works 

You need an identity provider that supports the {{variable.OpenId}} authentication protocol and the following information from your identity providers account:

* **Log Out URL**
* **Authority URL**
* **ClientID**
* **Client Secret**

Once you have all your details ready, you can enable the integration in a few clicks {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}}. Once you've compelted the integration, you customers will be able to log in to your {{variable.MembersPortal}} using the email and password they have on record with your identity provider instead of the credentials provided by {{variable.Nexudus}}.
