## What are {{variable.Credits_CAP}}?
{{variable.Credits_CAP}} are benefits that grant your customers either a certain amount of money to pay for bookings, products and such or a certain amount of time that they can use for bookings.

You can add credits as benefits to plans, products or add them directly through a customer's account in Nexudus.

Nexudus offers three credits that serve different purposes: 

* [{{variable.MoneyCredits_CAP}}](/v3/docs/credits#money-credits) 
* [{{variable.Timecredits_CAP}}](/v3/docs/credits#time-credits)
* [Printing Credits](/v3/docs/credits#printing-credits)


## How {{variable.Credits_CAP}} Work
### [Money Credits ](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/money-credits){target="_blank"}
Money credits are an amount of money that your customers can use to make purchases. You can add money credits to plans and products as benefits and customers can then make purchases using credits. 

Each money credit you create can be used to pay for any combination the following items: 

* Bookings
* Products 
* Event tickets 
* Charges 
* Plans

*For example, you can add a $50 money credit to a plan that is only valid to book meeting rooms or purchase event tickets.*
*Similarly, you can add money credits that can only be used to pay for products.*

:::(Info) (If your prices are set to include tax, make sure your money credits also include it. )
For example, if you want customers to be able to make purchases or bookings worth up to $100 using money credit and your space's tax rate is 20%, the money credit you add a benefit should be $120 to cover tax. 
:::

As money credits are considered benefits in Nexudus, they never add any charges to plans and products on their own. This means that you should increase your product or plan prices to factor in the amount of money credits you include as benefits. 

*If you have a monthly plan priced at $300 and add a $100 money credit to the plan, the plan will stay priced $300. It's up to you to increase the plan's price as needed to factor in the money credit you've included as a benefit.*

### [Time Credits](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/time-credits){target="_blank"} 
Time credits are unit-based credits that your customers can use to book resources in your space. You define number of minutes to include as benefits in plans or products and select how often the time credits should be renewed.

As time credits are considered benefits in Nexudus, they never add any charges to plans and products on their own. This means that you should increase your product or plan prices to factor in the amount of time credits you include as benefits. 

*If you have a monthly plan priced at $500 and add 10 hours of booking credit as a benefit, the plan will stay priced $300. It's up to you to increase the plan's price as needed to factor in the booking credit you've included as a benefit.*

### [Printing Credits](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/printing-credits){target="_blank"}
Printing credits are simply credits your customers can use to print in your space. Once you have a printing credit, you define the number of units to include per credit and how often the credit should be renewed when adding it as a benefit to plans and products. 

## Credits Validity
Credits you add to **plans** or **recurring products** expire every time the plan or product is renewed by default. You can change when the credits expire via the **Expiration** section of any credit added via the Benefits tab in plans, products or customer accounts. 


Credits that customers get through **one-off products** or that are manually added to their account by an admin are valid indefinitely by default, unless you edit their **Expiration** within the *Benefits* tab. 

## Credits Use
Depending on each credit's settings, the types of credits available in a customer's account and the customer's team status, the order in which credits are used will change. Fore more details, check out our guide on [Credits Usage](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/credits-usage){target="_blank"}.
