## What is {{variable.Salto}}?
{{variable.Salto}} is an access control system. Our integration with {{variable.Salto}} lets your customers access your space and unlock doors autonomously using Salto tags, PIN codes, or their phone. Their access is based on their purchases and automatically updated by {{variable.Nexudus}}.

## How the {{variable.Salto}} Integration Works

The integration relies on two components that connect to automatically provide door access to customers &mdash; **{{variable.Salto}} access group** and **passes, resources, desks, and offices in {{variable.Nexudus}}**.

Integrating {{variable.Salto}} is a simple three-step process: 

1. Create one {{variable.Salto}} access group per Nexudus pass, resource, desk, and office that should give your customers door access. 

2. Connect {{variable.Salto}} to {{variable.Nexudus}} {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}}.
3. Match each {{variable.Salto}} access group to the corresponding {{variable.Nexudus}} item.

Once the {{variable.Salto}} integration is complete, your customers can start unlocking doors using the {{variable.Salto}} app, the white-label Passport app, or {{variable.Salto}} tags. 


The doors they can unlock are linked to the access groups they're a part of based on their purchases, bookings, and contracts.

## FAQ
### Can I use any version of the Passport app to unlock {{variable.Salto}} doors? 
While all customers can unlock doors using the {{variable.Salto}} app or {{variable.Salto}} tags, door unlocking through Passport is only available to customers using a white-labeled version of the app. 

{{variable.MoreInformation}} [White-label Passport by Nexudus](/v3/docs/white-label-passport-by-nexudus){target="_blank"} and [Using the White-label Passport App with Salto KS](/v3/docs/using-salto-ks){target="_blank"}. 

{{variable.Customers_CAP}} who started using the {{variable.Passport}} before June 2020 can also use the app to unlock {{variable.Salto}} doors. 

### Do I have to connect all my resources, passes, desks, and offices to {{variable.Salto}}?
No, you can connect any number of {{variable.Nexudus}} items to {{variable.Salto}}, based on your {{variable.space}}'s needs.
