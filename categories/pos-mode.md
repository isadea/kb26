**POS** is one of two modes available for NexKIOSK. It is designed for admins to use as a staffed checkout that is directly linked to your Nexudus account.

You can think of POS mode as an extension of your {{variable.AdminPanel}} that lets you sell products, process customer payments, and access invoices. 

Admins can process customer purchases via the app and have them pay either by card or by adding the purchase to their next invoice. You can also process quick sales for guests and visitors.
