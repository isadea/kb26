You can easily create documents for {{variable.customers}} using {{variable.documenttemplates}}. 

How you create your documents depends on a few factors, including:
* whether you want to generate documents for **members** or **contacts**
* whether you want to **share** documents with customers or keep them **internal**
* whether you want to **request digital signatures** 

Here are some common scenarios where you can use document templates:

* You want to [generate an inventory list or contract](/docs/creating-documents-for-members-using-document-templates){target=`_blank`} for a customer moving into a private office and request their signature. 
* You want to [send a customer a quote](/docs/creating-documents-for-contacts-using-document-templates#creating-documents-without-digital-signature){target=`_blank`} for booking an event space with multiple add-ons but don't need their signature at this time. 
* You want to [track equipment assigned to a specific customer](/docs/creating-documents-for-contacts-using-document-templates#creating-internal-documents){target=`_blank`} and attach an internal copy to their record on the Admin Panel.

Check out [Creating Documents for Members](/docs/creating-documents-for-members-using-document-templates){target=`_blank`} or [Creating Documents for Contacts](/docs/creating-documents-for-contacts-using-document-templates){target=`_blank`} for additional guidance.
