## What is the White-label App?
The {{variable.WLApp}} is a customizable version of the standard {{variable.Passport}}. It includes the [standard {{variable.Passport}}](https://help.nexudus.com/v3/docs/passport-by-nexudus){target="_blank"} core features along with additional features exclusive to the white-label version of the app. 

Your {{variable.WLApp}} has its own name and download page on Google Play and the App Store. The app's logo, banner and colors are your own as well. The app looks like you've developed it yourself to offer a seamless branded experience to your customers. 


The white-label version of the Passport app also lets your customers unlock doors using the app if your space uses Brivo, Doordeck or Salto KS as an integrated access control system. 


You customers can download the white-label version of the Passport app on Android and iOS devices, as they would if you had developed the app yourself. 
:::(Info) (The white-label version of the Passport app adds a {{variable.Currencies}}150 monthly charge to your Nexudus subscription for every 5 locations.)
*For example, if you manage between 1 and 5 locations, you'll be charged {{variable.Currencies}}150 for the white-label app. If you manage between 6 and 10 locations, you'll be charged {{variable.Currencies}}300 to use the white-label app.*

## Why get the White-label App

### Seamless branded experience
The {{variable.WLApp}} removes any {{variable.Nexudus}} branding on the app and on the stores. Customers trying to download your app will see a custom app page on Google Play and the App Store. We replace all Nexudus branding that is on the standard Passport app with your space's logo, color scheme, and marketing content. 

### Let customers unlock doors with the app

The {{variable.WLApp}} lets your customers unlock doors using your app if you've integrated with one of the [supported access control systems](https://help.nexudus.com/docs/access-control#unlocking-doors-using-the-passport-app){target=`_blank`}.

Customers with door access can automatically see the tile on your app's home page and tap it to unlock the nearest door.
