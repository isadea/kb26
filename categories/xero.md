## What is {{variable.Xero}}?
{{variable.Xero}} is a cloud-based accounting software. Our integration with {{variable.Xero}} lets you: 

* Transfer invoices you created in {{variable.Nexudus}} to {{variable.Xero}} 
* Process payments for {{variable.Nexudus}} invoices in {{variable.Xero}} 
* Sync invoice payments processed in {{variable.Xero}} back to {{variable.Nexudus}}

## How the {{variable.Xero}} integration works
You need a matching chart of accounts in {{variable.Nexudus}} and {{variable.Xero}}. You also need matching tax rates in {{variable.Nexudus}} and {{variable.Xero}}. 

Once your chart of accounts and tax rates match in both platforms, you can easily enable the integration on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. After enabling the integration on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}, you can transfer invoices from {{variable.Nexudus}} to {{variable.Xero}}. You can then process payments for unpaid {{variable.Nexudus}} invoices in {{variable.Xero}} and run a second transfer to update their status in {{variable.Nexudus}}.

## Using {{variable.Xero}} as a Payment Method
Our accounting integration with {{variable.Xero}} also lets your {{variable.customers}} pay their invoices on your {{variable.MembersPortal}} using a payment provider set up in your {{variable.Xero}} account.
