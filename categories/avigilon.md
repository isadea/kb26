## What is Avigilon? 
Avigilon is an access control system that lets your customers access your space and unlock doors autonomously with access cards. 


## How the Avigilon Integration Works
You create access groups in Avigilon for every pass, resource, desk and office you have in your Nexudus inventory. Each access group includes a set of doors that can be unlocked based on the item you want to connect with Nexudus. 

*For example, the Avigilon access group dedicated to a resource needs to include your space's front door, the resource's door and any other door customers may need to open in-between.* 

Once your access groups are ready in Avigilon, you can [enable the integration](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/integrating-avigilon){target="_blank"} in a few steps {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}}. Once the integration is enabled, your customers are able to unlock doors based on the passes they hold, the resources they book, and the floor plan items linked to their contracts.
