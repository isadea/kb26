:::(Internal) (Private notes)

**How do you assess the time needed for what they ask? For example, they buy 10 hours and ask for way more.** 

**What's outside of the scope aside from integrations**
Document templates / imports 

For now, just basic settings. 
Everything else is paid 

Tracker - turn it on and see how much time it takes 
Purchase 10hours and you're done 

**Onboarding** 
500 minimum start 
200 per extra location 
flat basic settings fee 

**Package + AMA + Support Plus**

Naming not changing - you can create the variables 
Not automated now - fee waived // then regular pricing 
:::

You nedd to pick an onboarding package when you start using Nexudus and every time you open a new location with us. You can choose from one of three packages that have different levels of support.
