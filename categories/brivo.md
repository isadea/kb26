## FAQ
### Is {{variable.Brivo}} Magic Button available with this integration? 
Yes, as long as you use Brivo's own readers. If you use any third-party readers that are then connected to Brivo, your customer won't be able to use the Magic Button feature. They'll still be able to unlock doors using either apps, but they'll need to manually select the door they want to unlock on the app.
