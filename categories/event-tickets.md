## What are Event Tickets?
Event tickets give customers access to the events organized by your space. Every event you create in Nexudus needs tickets to register event attendees on the {{variable.AdminPanel}} and let customers RSVP from the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. All events should have tickets, even if they are free, to let customers RSVP from the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. If your events don't have any tickets, admins will need to manually register every attendee on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}.

Nexudus event tickets work similarly to standard digital tickets with customers receiving their tickets via email once they purchase them on the {{variable.MembersPortal}} or an admin adds them to their account on the {{variable.AdminPanel}}.



## How Event Tickets Work
Once you have [an event](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/events-1){target="_blank"} in Nexudus, you can start adding tickets to it. Event tickets can have a set price or be free. A single event can have multiple ticket types with different prices that apply to:

* All customers
* Only members
* Only members signed up to a specific plan
* Only contacts

Event tickets can also have limits such as how many of them can be purchased by a single customer and how many tickets are available in total based on the event capacity. 

:::(Info) (Nexudus doesn't charge or commission sales of tickets priced at $/€/£0.)
:::
:::(Warning) (All event tickets that you sell via Nexudus with a price above 0 are charged {{variable.Currencies}}0.50 along with a 1% commission per ticket sold.)

*For example, if you sell a $10 event ticket via Nexudus, we add a $0.60 charge to your monthly Nexudus subscription for each ticket you sell.*

**Tickets purchased using money credits also incur that charge.**
