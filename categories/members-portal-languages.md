## Supported Languages on the {{variable.MembersPortal}} 
The {{variable.MembersPortal}} is available in the following languages 

{{snippet.LanguagesList_MembersPortal}}

Your {{variable.MembersPortal}} language is based on each user's browser default language. If their browser language isn't part of the available languages, the {{variable.MembersPortal}} is displayed in English by default.

*For example, if a customer's browser default language is Romanian, the {{variable.MembersPortal}} will be displayed in English.*

If you're using version 4 of the {{variable.MembersPortal}}, you can easily switch between languages by scrolling down to the bottom of any page. From there, you can select any other language from the drop-down list.

Once a user selects a language via this menu, the portal remains in the language until they change it again, no matter which browser default language they use.

## Editing Default Translations 
You can tweak the translation of any of the languages {{variable.Nexudus}} supports by default. This is particularly useful if you want your {{variable.MembersPortal}} to match the way your brand usually communicates with {{variable.customers}}.  

You can translate any text on the {{variable.MembersPortal}} by finding and editing the relevant translation tokens. All your edits are live shortly after you save them.

## Translating Your {{variable.MembersPortal}} 

You can also easily translate your {{variable.MembersPortal}} in any language of your choice if {{variable.Nexudus}} doesn't support it already.

*For example, you want to translate your {{variable.MembersPortal}} in Turkish or Bulgarian.*

The translation process is simple, but it will usually take a few days for you to translate all the tokens available on your portal.
