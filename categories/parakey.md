## What is {{variable.Parakey}}
{{variable.Parakey}} is a cloud-based access control system that lets your customers unlock doors based on the bookings they make, and the passes and contracts they have in {{variable.Nexudus}}.

## How {{variable.Parakey}} works 
All you need to get started is a [**{{variable.Parakey}} subscription**](https://en.parakey.co/pricing){target=`_blank`} and your **{{variable.Nexudus}} account**. From there, the integration is a simple three-step process: 

1. **Add the Nexudus native integration in Parakey**
2. **Register {{variable.Parakey}} as a custom ACS in Nexudus**
3. **Match your {{variable.Parakey}} keys to resources, plans, and passes in {{variable.Nexudus}}**

Once you've established the connection between the two platforms, your customers can [automatically unlock doors](/docs/using-parakey){target=`_blank`} based on their purchases. 

:::(Warning) (Using {{variable.Parakey}} adds a {{variable.Currencies}} 50 charge to your {{variable.Nexudus}} subscription per {{glossary.location}} where it is in use.)
