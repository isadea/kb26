You can create a structure for companies using two of the templates available in the **Customers** section of the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. 

This setup allows you to create a team with merged invoicing, two customer accounts (company and individual) for the company's main contact, and add all the company's staff to the team in two simple steps. 

## Step 1. Creating a Company Structure 
Using the **Company structure** template will automatically creates: 

* **A team for the company**

* **Two customer records for the company's main contact**
*The company customer is automatically defined as the team's paying customer, while the individual customer record can be used by the company's main contact as their personal account.*

2. {{snippet.OperationsCustomers_PathStep}}
3. Click **Add customer**.
4. Select **Company structure**. 

4. Add the **Company name**. 
:::(Info) (This will also be the team's name by default.)
:::
5. Add the **Main contact full name**. 

6. Add the main contact's **Email address**.


7. Click **Add customer**. 

The company's main contact now has two customer records: a company account and an individual one.

You can also find the company's team in the **Teams** listings.

## Step 2. Adding Company Staff as Customers
Once you've created the company structure all you need to do is add all the people working for that company as customers using the **Multiple customers** template. 

1. {{snippet.FirstStepProcedure}}
2. {{snippet.OperationsCustomers_PathStep}}
3. Click **Add customer**. 

4. Select **Multiple customers**.
5. Select the company's **Team**. 
6. Select a **Plan**. 
:::(Info) (This will automatically sign up all the company staff to the selected plan and create a contract for each of them that will be invoiced to the team paying customer.)
:::
7. Enable the **Send welcome message** toggle if you want the company members to be able to access your Members Portal. 

8. Add staff members in the **Full names and emails** field by typing their full name followed by their email address, making sure:
- there's a space between the member's name and their email address
- each new member is added as a single line

9. Click **Add customer**.

All the listed company staff members now have an individual customer account in Nexudus and you can find them within the company's team, under the **Members** tab.
