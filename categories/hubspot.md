## How data is shared between Nexudus and {{variable.HubSpot}}

HubSpot for {{variable.Nexudus}} is a two-way integration &mdash; most of the records you create and update in HubSpot are synced in Nexudus and the records you create and update in Nexudus are synced in HubSpot.

Some {{variable.HubSpot}} records such as pipelines, deals, and stages can only be updated from HubSpot. While you can only edit them from {{variable.HubSpot}}, they are always synced in Nexudus. You can also update the **notes** on any of these records in Nexudus and have that information synced in {{variable.HubSpot}}.
