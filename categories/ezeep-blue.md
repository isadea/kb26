## What's {{variable.EzeepBlue}}? 
{{variable.EzeepBlue}} is a printing management platform that lets your {{variable.customers}} print online. You can let them print for free, with credits, or on a pay-per-print basis. Print jobs recorded in {{variable.EzeepBlue}} are synced in {{variable.Nexudus}} for easy tracking and billing. 



## How {{variable.EzeepBlue}} Works 

Once you've set up your {{variable.EzeepBlue}} account and your printers, you can enable the integration {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}}. You also import your first round of {{variable.customers}} to {{variable.EzeepBlue}} as you complete the integration.

When Nexudus creates a user account in {{variable.EzeepBlue}} for new {{variable.customers}}, they receive an email notification from {{variable.EzeepBlue}} prompting them to log in to their {{variable.EzeepBlue}} account. Once they have accessed their {{variable.EzeepBlue}} account for the first time, they're able to start printing from any of their devices.
