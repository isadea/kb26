## What is reCAPTCHA?

reCAPTCHA is a Google service that helps you avoid spam by adding a validation step at the end of your website's forms. This step prevents malicious software or bots from automatically filling forms on your website.



## How the reCAPTCHA Integration Works
Once the integration is enabled, any form on your website will include a reCAPTCHA at the bottom of the form. Users won't be able to send any form until they successfully complete the reCAPTCHA test. 
:::(warning) (reCAPTCHA is automatically enabled on the Contact form of your Members Portal.)
This reCAPTCHA cannot be disabled to protect your portal and Nexudus servers from spam.
