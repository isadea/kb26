## What is {{variable.MicrosoftTeams}}?
Teams is a Microsoft enterprise collaboration platform. Our integration lets users access different sections, including the **Bookings** pages of your {{variable.MembersPortal}} and make bookings directly from Teams. Teams users have access to all the views (card, calendar, floor plan,and map) of the {{variable.MembersPortal}} **Bookings** section. 
:::(Info) (Pro tip!)
Pair the {{variable.MicrosoftTeams}} integration with our [Azure SSO integration](/v3/docs/azure-ad){target="_blank"} for a seamless experience to users to book meeting rooms and desks, check who else in the office and manage their bookings.
