## 1. Defining Your Location's General Settings 
The first step is to make sure that all your business general details are set up properly in each of your locations. This includes your address, space name and billing details.

## 2. Onboarding Your Staff and Teams 
Once you've covered your general settings, the best way to get started is to add your staff to the platform. Not only will it help you familiarise yourself with the different user types available in Nexudus, it will also give your team an opportunity to see what the platform looks like on the admin and the customer side. 

## 3. Building Your Inventory 
Once your staff is onboarded, you start building your inventory. Your inventory lists all the items and services you sell to customers. It also helps you track your space's inventory and manage your floor plans. 
Our knowledge base includes numerous introductory articles and tutorials to help you understand each item and set them up based on your space's requirements.

## 4. Customizing Your Customer Notifications 
Once you've built your inventory, you can tackle customer notifications. Customer notifications are simply email notifications that Nexudus automatically sends to your customers when certain actions are recorded in their account, such as bookings, due payments, or even visitor check-ins.

Customer notifications are highly customisable to help you keep your brand's design and tone of voice.

## 5. Creating Customers and Teams
Once you've defined customer notifications, you can start building your customer base in Nexudus. You can manually add customers and teams if you only have a few or use our nifty import template to add customers in bulk. 

## 6. Customizing Your Members Portal and Apps 
Once you've covered your customer notifications, you can dive into your Members Portal customization. You can customize a fair amount of features and design elements on your portal through settings and tutorials alone. As a fully white-label platform, Nexudus also gives you access to your Members Portal template files to let you edit its 

## 7. Working with Integrations 

One of the last steps of your account's basic setup is enabling all the relevant integrations in your locations. We integrate with dozens of other platforms to help you connect the services you already use to your Nexudus account. 

Our knowledge base offers numerous step-by-step tutorials to help you enable the relevant integrations in no time. 

## 8. Preparing Your First Billing Cycle

The last step of your setup is also the most crucial. Preparing for your first billing cycle will help you understand how billing, payments, refunds and cancellations work in Nexudus. It will also help you course correct if anything doesn't go as you initially intended.
