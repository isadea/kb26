## What is the My Building {{variable.dashboard}} 

The **My Building** {{variable.dashboard}} lets you share your {{variable.sensor}} data with your {{variable.customers}} in a few clicks.

You can select which {{variable.sensor}} data you'd like to see displayed on the **My Building** {{variable.dashboard}} and remove them from the {{variable.dashboard}}  at any time. 

## How the My Building page works 

All you need to start using the **My Building** {{variable.dashboard}} is {{variable.sensors}}. Having your {{variable.sensors}} linked to {{variable.resources}} or {{variable.floorplanitems}} helps display the sensor's data under the **Floor** and **Resource** tabs, but it isn't required to use the {{variable.dashboard}}.

You can easily add or remove {{variable.sensors}} from the **My Building** {{variable.dashboard}} by opening any {{variable.sensor}} {{variable.OnTheAdminPanel}} and toggling **Show in the portal or the app when users are logged in** on or off.
