## How the {{variable.Moloni}} integration works
You connect your {{variable.Moloni}} account to your {{variable.Nexudus}} account by matching your tax rates on both platforms and creating a document set. You can then transfer your invoices from {{variable.Nexudus}} to {{variable.Moloni}}, where you'll be able to format your invoices as needed.

{{variable.Moloni}}’s *Basic* plan doesn’t support API access which is required for this integration.
