## FAQ 
### Why can't I add last minute attendees on the fly? 
Your events need to include a free ticket to allow last minute registrations. This is due to the fact that the app is designed for check-in and not a point of sale. You can, however, let customers scan the QR code available on the app to purchase a ticket via your Members Portal. 

### Can I remove one of the modes? 
No, you cannot remove either of the modes. You won't be prompted to pick a mode again unless you fully close the app and reopen it.
