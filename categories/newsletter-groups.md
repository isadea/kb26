## What are Newsletter Subscriber Groups? 

Subscriber groups let you send your {{variable.newsletters}} to a select group of {{variable.customers}}. You can rely on smart groups or manually build your {{variable.subscriber}} groups.

## How  Newsletter Subscriber Groups Work

You can create {{variable.subscriber}} groups based on the different customers you want to target. Each group is a specific {{variable.customer}} subset you want to reach with one or more of your {{variable.newsletters}}. Whenever you are ready to send a {{variable.newsletter}}, you just need to select the relevant group. 

*For example, you can have a group for {{variable.members}} of a specific {{variable.plan}} and one for {{variable.contacts}} to send them different {{variable.newsletters}}.* 

There are two types of {{variable.subscriber}} groups: **smart** and **manual**.

:::(Warning) (Each subscriber group can include up to 1,000 subscribers by default. )
You can {{variable.ContactSupport}} to request an increase. The increase to 2,500 subscribers per group costs **$25 per month**.

### Smart Subscriber Groups

This type of {{variable.subscriber}} group is automatically updated when {{variable.users}} meet selected conditions. Smart groups are updated **every 12 hours**. Users who stop meeting the defined conditions are automatically removed from the groups.

To create smart groups, see [Adding Smart Subscriber Groups](/docs/adding-smart-subscriber-groups)

### Manual Subscriber Groups

This type of {{variable.subscriber}} group requires you to manually add and remove {{variable.subscribers}} from the group. A great option for very targeted {{variable.newsletters}} with only a handful of {{variable.customers}} to reach.
