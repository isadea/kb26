## How Tapirx Works
Once you've integrated Tapirx, the devices are connected to Nexudus resources and display information such as each resource's name along with the current and upcoming bookings of the resources. 

Your customers can see on the device if the resource is available and book the resource by scanning the QR code displayed on the Tapirx device.
