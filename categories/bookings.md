## FAQ
### Can customers edit their bookings if all bookings require admin confirmation? 
Yes, customers can edit any of their bookings, even if all you require an initial admin confirmation. The bookings will just remain tentative until an {{variable.admin}} confirms it.

### Can I edit the price of a product sold via a booking? 
You can sell  products at a different rate when they are bought via a booking through the Products tab of a resource. You cannot edit the price of these products directly from the booking. 

### Why can't I see a customer when trying to make a booking for them? 

If you're trying to make a booking for a customer from the {{variable.AdminPanel}} and they don't show up in the list, they are suspended. You cannot create a booking for suspended customers. To solve this issue all you need to do is [unsuspend the customer](/v3/docs/activating-customer-accounts){target="_blank"}.
