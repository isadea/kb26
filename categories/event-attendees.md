## What are Event Attendees? 
Event attendees are simply users who received tickets for an event organized by your space. Event attendees can be customers or people outside of your customer base that your customers registered when they purchased multiple tickets via the {{variable.MembersPortal}}.

## How Event Attendees Work

Whenever a customer purchases tickets for an event via the {{variable.MembersPortal}} or you sell them a ticket via the {{variable.AdminPanel}}, they are automatically added to the relevant event's **Attendees** tab. 

As an admin, you can also register people outside of your space as event attendees. Doing so will automatically create a contact record for them in Nexudus. 

When customers register event attendees while purchasing event tickets on the {{variable.MembersPortal}}, the external attendees aren't automatically added as contacts in Nexudus. 

## Event Attendees Check-in
You have two options to record event attendees check-in in Nexudus. You can either [let them check in](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/using-nexevents){target="_blank"} using tablets and [NexEvents](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/nexevents){target="_blank"}  or you can [manually check them in](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/checking-in-events-attendees){target="_blank"} via the {{variable.AdminPanel}}.
