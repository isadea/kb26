## What is {{variable.ACT}}?

{{variable.ACT}} is an access control system that lets your customers autonomously unlock doors and access different areas of space using access cards, fobs or their phone via automation tiles. Customers are automatically added to cardholder groups as they purchase passes, make bookings or rent desks and offices.

:::(Warning) (Using the {{variable.ACT}} integration adds a **$/£/€50 monthly charge** to your Nexudus subscription per location enabled.)

## How the {{variable.ACT}} Integration Works
You need to create access groups in your {{variable.ACT}} account. Each access group includes access to one or more doors that customers should be able to unlock. You need an access group in {{variable.ACT}} for each pass, resource, desk, and office you have in your Nexudus account. You can then enable the integration in Nexudus and connect the access groups to the corresponding Nexudus items. 

Once you complete the integration customers will be able to unlock doors using key fobs, access cards or automation tiles based on their purchases.
