## What are {{variable.Events_CAP}}? 
Events are a feature to create, manage, and monetize events happening in your space. They're a great way to build community and transform your space into a hub where people evolving in different industries can meet and spend valuable time together. 


### Physical and Virtual {{variable.Events_CAP}} 
Events can be physical, virtual or a combination of both. 

**Physical events** are simply events that happen in one or several of your locations. They can be linked to resources in your space that automatically can't be booked by customers for the duration of the events.

**Virtual events** are events that include either a {{variable.Zoom}} conference call or a {{variable.Zoom}} webinar link. They are a great alternative to physical events if you cannot host people in your space for any reason. 

:::(Info) ( You must enable the [{{variable.Zoom}} integration](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/zoom){target="_blank"} to use this feature.)
:::

You can also create hybrid events that happen in your space and include {{variable.Zoom}} links for people who prefer to attend the event remotely. 


## Event categories
Event categories help you group the different types of events you offer. Event categories are also filters that your customers can use to quickly find relevant events on the {{variable.MembersPortal}}. 

{{variable.MoreInformation}} [Event Categories](/v3/docs/event-categories){target="_blank"}.

## {{variable.EventAttendees_CAP}}
You can make your events available to any customer, only members or only contacts. You also have the option to set a maximum number of attendees for any of your events. 

{{variable.MoreInformation}} [Event Attendees](/v3/docs/event-attendees){target="_blank"}.

## {{variable.Events_CAP}} tickets
Events can be free, but you can also sell tickets and open a new revenue stream for your space. Free event tickets don't add charges to your {{variable.Nexudus}} subscription. {{variable.Nexudus}} takes a [commission](https://help.nexudus.com//v3/docs/nexudus-pricing){target="_blank"} on tickets you sell, in line with other ticketing platforms.
