## How pricing Works in Nexudus

Nexudus charges you on a **monthly basis** based on how many [active users](https://nexudus.document360.io/v3/docs/who-is-considered-an-active-user-in-nexudus){target="_blank"} you have in each of your locations. Your baseline subscription is automatically adjusted to match the exact number of active users you have per location. 

On top of the baseline subscription, you are also charged when you enable some integrations, apps, features and payment gateways in Nexudus.

## How Nexudus invoices you 
You receive an individual invoice every month per location. The number of active users is calculated individually for each location. 

*For example, if you have three locations in your network, you will receive three separate invoices from Nexudus that each have their own active user count.*

Most integrations and apps are charged per location. You can see the integration charges in each location's invoice. 

Features such as **Nexudus Explore Pro** are charged at the network level. You will see the total charge for the Pro feature in your network location's invoice.
