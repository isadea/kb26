## What are help-desk departments?

Help-desk departments help categorize the different help-desk {{variable.messages}} you receive to simplify your day-to-day operations. 

*For example, you can [create](/docs/adding-help-desk-departments){target=`_blank`} a help-desk department to handle IT queries, another one to handle event requests, and a third one to handle cancellation requests.*

These categories will be available when {{variable.customers}} send a help-desk request from the {{variable.MembersPortal}}

## How help-desk departments work 

Each department can be assigned a manager who’ll be notified via email whenever a {{variable.customer}} or {{variable.admin}} sends a new request linked to the department. They can then arrange staff to help the {{variable.customer}}. 

All {{variable.admins}} with access to the help-desk can see any open, critical, or closed request by clicking on the Help-desk section of the {{variable.AdminPanel}}. Only {{variable.admins}} with {{variable.customer}} accounts can [respond to help-desk messages](/docs/managing-help-desk-requests){target=`_blank`}.

:::(Warning) (Admin users also need a **{{variable.customer}} account** to answer help-desk messages.)
If your {{variable.admin}} doesn't already have a {{variable.customer}} account, follow our tutorial on [Creating Customer Accounts for Admin Users](/v3/docs/creating-customer-accounts-for-admin-users){target="_blank"}.
